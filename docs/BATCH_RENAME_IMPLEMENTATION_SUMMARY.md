# Batch Rename TV Series Feature - Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive batch rename feature for ARM (Automatic Ripping Machine) that allows users to select multiple completed TV series discs and rename their output folders to use a consistent naming scheme with series names and disc labels.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`arm/ui/batch_rename/__init__.py`** - Blueprint package initialization
2. **`arm/ui/batch_rename/batch_rename.py`** - Main backend implementation with Flask routes and API endpoints
3. **`arm/ui/batch_rename/templates/batch_rename.html`** - Complete frontend UI with JavaScript functionality
4. **`test/unittest/test_batch_rename.py`** - Comprehensive unit tests
5. **`docs/BATCH_RENAME_FEATURE.md`** - Detailed feature documentation
6. **`docs/BATCH_RENAME_EXAMPLES.md`** - Usage examples and scenarios

### Files Modified:

1. **`arm/ui/forms.py`** - Added `BatchRenameForm` class for form handling
2. **`arm/ui/__init__.py`** - Registered the new batch rename blueprint
3. **`arm/ui/templates/nav.html`** - Added navigation link to the batch rename feature

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Job Selection and Filtering
- Automatically filters to show only completed TV series jobs (`status='success'`, `video_type='series'`)
- Only shows jobs with valid output paths
- Displays job details including poster, title, date, and current path

### 2. Series Information Analysis
- Detects common series names from selected jobs
- Identifies conflicts when multiple different series are selected
- Provides warnings and allows manual override

### 3. Flexible Naming Options
- **Detected Name**: Uses the series name detected from job titles
- **Custom Name**: Allows user to specify a completely custom series name
- **Naming Pattern**: `[SeriesName]_[DiscLabel]` (e.g., `Breaking-Bad_BREAKING-BAD-S01-D1`)

### 4. Preview and Safety Features
- **Preview Mode**: Shows exactly what the new folder names will be before executing
- **Safety Checks**: Validates that target folders don't already exist
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission issues, missing paths, etc.
- **Detailed Results**: Shows success/failure status for each rename operation

### 5. User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Selection**: Click cards to select, bulk select all/none options
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation prevents invalid operations
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading modals and detailed result reporting
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent with ARM's existing UI themes

## API Endpoints

### Main Page
- `GET /batch_rename` - Main batch rename interface

### API Operations
- `POST /get_series_info` - Analyze selected jobs for series information and conflicts
- `POST /preview_rename` - Generate preview of what new names will be
- `POST /execute_rename` - Perform the actual folder renaming operation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Blueprint Architecture**: Follows ARM's existing blueprint pattern
- **Database Integration**: Uses existing ARM models (Job, Config, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with logging
- **Safety Checks**: Validates paths, permissions, and prevents conflicts

### Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features with proper event handling  
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Consistent with ARM's existing UI framework
- **AJAX Operations**: Smooth user experience with API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### Database Operations
- **Read-Only Analysis**: Job analysis doesn't modify database
- **Safe Updates**: Only updates `job.path` and optionally `job.title_manual`
- **Transaction Safety**: Proper error handling and rollback on failures

## Integration with Existing ARM Features

### Leverages Existing Components
- **ARM Models**: Uses existing `Job`, `Config` models
- **Utility Functions**: Integrates with `ripper_utils.clean_for_filename()`
- **Authentication**: Uses ARM's existing login system
- **Navigation**: Integrated into main navigation menu
- **Styling**: Consistent with ARM's UI themes and patterns

### Maintains ARM Conventions
- **Error Handling**: Follows ARM's logging and error reporting patterns
- **Code Style**: Consistent with existing ARM codebase style
- **Blueprint Structure**: Uses ARM's blueprint organization pattern
- **Form Handling**: Uses ARM's existing form framework

## Testing

### Unit Tests Included
- Series information analysis (same series vs. conflicts)
- Preview rename generation logic
- Custom name override functionality  
- Job filtering criteria validation
- Edge cases (missing labels, no paths, etc.)

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, covering the core business logic of the feature.

## Usage Scenario Example

**Before**: ARM creates folders like:
```
Breaking Bad (2008)
Breaking Bad (2008)_1704735891
Breaking Bad (2008)_1704735923
```

**After** using batch rename:
```
Breaking-Bad_BREAKING-BAD-S01-D1
Breaking-Bad_BREAKING-BAD-S01-D2  
Breaking-Bad_BREAKING-BAD-S02-D1
```

This makes it much easier to:
1. Identify episode content by disc label
2. Use external batch renaming tools
3. Organize media libraries consistently

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Simplified Management**: Easy batch operations instead of manual folder renaming
- **Consistent Naming**: Standardized folder names across all series
- **Better Organization**: Disc labels provide clear content identification
- **Time Saving**: Process multiple discs at once instead of individually

### For ARM Project
- **Enhanced TV Series Support**: Builds on the existing `USE_DISC_LABEL_FOR_TV_SERIES` feature
- **User-Friendly**: Addresses common user pain points with TV series ripping
- **Extensible**: Framework can be extended for other batch operations
- **Professional Quality**: Production-ready code with tests and documentation

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

The framework established here could be extended to support:
- Batch operations for movies
- Batch metadata updates
- Integration with external episode databases
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Bulk permission fixes
- Custom naming templates

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready batch rename feature that significantly improves ARM's TV series handling capabilities. It maintains full compatibility with existing ARM functionality while adding powerful new capabilities for managing completed TV series rips.
